# Swiggy Clone

## Description

The Swiggy Clone is a web application built with React that replicates the core features of the popular food delivery service, Swiggy. Users can browse a variety of restaurants, filter by cuisine, and sort meals to find their favorite dishes easily. This project utilizes the MealDB API for fetching meal data.

## Features

- **Restaurant and Meal Browsing**: Users can explore a range of meals from different restaurants.
- **Filter by Area**: Users can filter meals based on geographic areas.
- **Sorting Options**: Meals can be sorted in alphabetical order, either ascending or descending.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and provides a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Loading and Error Handling**: Displays loading indicators and handles errors during data fetching gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Fetch API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nilesh-geeks/NileshGupta_FrontedDeveloper.git
   ```

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
